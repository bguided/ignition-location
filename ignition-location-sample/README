Pre-requisites to make this work:
- if you are using Eclipse:
	- since this library uses AspectJ, you need to download the AJDT 
	  plug-in (http://www.eclipse.org/ajdt/). The AJDT Version we use is 
	  2.1.3.e37x-20110628-1900 with AspectJ version: 1.6.11
	- convert your project to an AspectJ project by right clicking and choosing 
	  Configure > Convert to AspectJ Project
- if you are using IntelliJ Idea:
	- TODO
